The Set interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is declared as follows:
public interface Set<E> extends Collection<E>

All Superinterfaces:
Collection<E>, Iterable<E>
All Known Subinterfaces:
NavigableSet<E>, SortedSet<E>
All Known Implementing Classes:
AbstractSet, ConcurrentHashMap.KeySetView, ConcurrentSkipListSet,
CopyOnWriteArraySet, EnumSet, HashSet, JobStateReasons, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

Implementing Classes:
1. HashSet:
Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();

2. LinkedHashSet:
Set<String> linkedHashSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();

3. TreeSet:
Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();

4. EnumSet:
Set<YourEnumType> enumSet = EnumSet.noneOf(YourEnumType.class);

5: AbstractSet:
Set<String> abstractSet = new HashSet<>();

6: ConcurrentHashMap.KeySetView:
Set<String> keySetView = ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet();

7. ConcurrentSkipListSet:
Set<String> concurrentSkipListSet = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>();

8. CopyOnWriteArraySet:
Set<String> copyOnWriteArraySet = new CopyOnWriteArraySet<>();

9. JobStateReasons:
Set<String> jobStateReasons = new JobStateReasons();

Methods Inherited from Collection:
1. boolean add(E element)
2. boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
3. void clear()
4. boolean contains(Object o)
5. boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)
6. boolean equals(Object o)
7. int hashCode()
8. boolean isEmpty()
9. Iterator<E> iterator()
10. boolean remove(Object o)
11. boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)
12. boolean removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter)
13. boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c)
14. int size()
15. Object[] toArray()
16. <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)

Set-Specific Methods:
No Duplicates:
Sets do not allow duplicate elements. Adding an element that is already present will have no effect.

No Indexing:
Unlike lists, sets do not provide index-based access to elements, as they are not ordered.

No Get Method:
Sets don't have a get method to retrieve an element at a specific index.

No Sublist:
Sets do not support sublists, as they are not ordered.

Set Operations:
Union, intersection, and difference operations can be performed using addAll,
retainAll, and removeAll methods, respectively.
Set<String> set1 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C"));
Set<String> set2 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("B", "C", "D"));

// Union
set1.addAll(set2);

// Intersection
set1.retainAll(set2);

// Difference
set1.removeAll(set2);

Characteristics of Set:
1. No Duplicates:
A Set does not allow duplicate elements. If you attempt to add an element that is already present,
the add method will return false, and the set will remain unchanged.

2. Unordered:
The elements in a Set do not have a specific order.
The order of elements is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were added.

3.Implements Collection Interface:
The Set interface extends the Collection interface, which means it inherits methods like add,
remove, contains, and others from the Collection interface.
 
4. Common Implementations:
Three primary implementations of the Set interface are HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
Each has its own characteristics:
HashSet: Uses a hash table for storage, providing constant-time average complexity for basic operations
like add, remove, and contains.
LinkedHashSet: Maintains the order of insertion, using a linked list in addition to a hash table.
TreeSet: Maintains elements in a sorted order (according to their natural order or a specified comparator).

5. No Indexing:
Unlike List, elements in a Set cannot be accessed by an index. There is no get method,
as the order of elements is not guaranteed.

6. Null Elements:
Most Set implementations do not allow null elements. 
However, some implementations like HashSet do permit a single null element.

7. Fail-Fast Iteration:
Iterators of Set implementations are generally fail-fast, 
meaning they will throw a ConcurrentModificationException if the set is modified
while an iteration is in progress.
