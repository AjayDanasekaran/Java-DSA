The NavigableSet interface in Java extends the SortedSet interface and introduces additional methods
specifically designed for navigation and retrieval operations based on the order of elements. 
Here are some of the methods in the NavigableSet interface:

1. E ceiling(E e):
Returns the least element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.

2. E floor(E e):
Returns the greatest element in this set less than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element.

3. E higher(E e):
Returns the least element in this set strictly greater than the given element, or null if there is no such element.

4. E lower(E e):
Returns the greatest element in this set strictly less than the given element, or null if there is no such element.

5. E pollFirst():
Retrieves and removes the first (lowest) element, or returns null if this set is empty.

6. E pollLast():
Retrieves and removes the last (highest) element, or returns null if this set is empty.

7. NavigableSet<E> descendingSet():
Returns a reverse order view of this set.

8. Iterator<E> descendingIterator():
Returns an iterator over the elements in this set, in descending order.

9. NavigableSet<E> subSet(E fromElement, boolean fromInclusive, E toElement, boolean toInclusive):
Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromElement to toElement.

10. NavigableSet<E> headSet(E toElement, boolean inclusive):
Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement.

11. NavigableSet<E> tailSet(E fromElement, boolean inclusive):
Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement.

12. Iterator<E> iterator():
Returns an iterator over the elements in this set, in ascending order.
