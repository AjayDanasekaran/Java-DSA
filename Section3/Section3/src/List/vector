"vector legacy" is often associated with the Vector class, which is part of the Java Collections Framework.
The Vector class has certain methods that are specific to it and are not available in other collection classes like ArrayList or LinkedList.
Here are some of the methods specific to the Vector class:

1. addElement(Object obj):
	Adds the specified component to the end of this vector, increasing its size by one.

2. elementAt(int index):
	Returns the component at the specified index.

3. firstElement():
	Returns the first component (the item at index 0) of this vector.

4. lastElement():
	Returns the last component of the vector.

5. removeElement(Object obj):
	Removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this vector.

6. removeElementAt(int index):
	Deletes the component at the specified index.

7. removeAllElements():
	Removes all components from this vector and sets its size to zero.

8. capacity():
	Returns the current capacity of this vector.

9. trimToSize():
	Trims the capacity of this vector to be the vector's current size.

10. setSize(int newSize):
	Sets the size of this vector to the specified size.
	
11. elements():
	Returns an enumeration of the components of this vector.
