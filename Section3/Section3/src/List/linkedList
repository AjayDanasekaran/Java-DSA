Linked lists in Java have some methods that are specific to them and are not available in other classes. 
Here are a few of them:

2. addFirst() and addLast(): 
	Linked lists in Java (e.g., LinkedList class) have methods to add elements at the beginning (addFirst())
	or end (addLast()) of the list. These operations are not available in some other standard collection classes.

4. getFirst() and getLast():
	Linked lists provide methods to retrieve the first (getFirst()) and last (getLast()) elements of the list.
	This is specific to linked lists and not available in other standard collections like arrays or sets.

6. removeFirst() and removeLast():
	Similarly, linked lists offer methods to remove the first (removeFirst()) and last (removeLast()) elements from the list.
	These operations are not available in arrays or other collection classes.

8. offer(), offerFirst(), and offerLast(): 
	These methods are specific to linked lists and are used for adding elements with different behaviors, 
	like adding at the end (offerLast()) or at the beginning (offerFirst()).

10. poll(), pollFirst(), and pollLast(): 
	Linked lists provide methods to remove and return elements from different positions, 
	such as the head (poll()), first (pollFirst()), or last (pollLast()). These methods are not available in other collection classes.
