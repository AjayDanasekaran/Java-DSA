Certainly! The Deque interface in Java stands for "double-ended queue." 
It extends the Queue interface and provides a more complete and flexible set of methods for working
with double-ended queues, where elements can be inserted and removed from both ends.

implementing classes of the Deque interface:
1. ArrayDeque:
Deque<String> arrayDeque = new ArrayDeque<>();

2. LinkedList:
Deque<String> linkedListDeque = new LinkedList<>();

3. LinkedBlockingDeque:
Deque<String> linkedBlockingDeque = new LinkedBlockingDeque<>();

3. ArrayBlockingDeque:
Deque<String> arrayBlockingDeque = new ArrayBlockingDeque<>();

Methods for Adding Elements:
2. addFirst(E e) and addLast(E e):
	Adds the specified element to the front or end of the deque.
	Throws an exception if the operation fails.

4. offerFirst(E e) and offerLast(E e):
	Inserts the specified element at the front or end of the deque.
	Returns true if successful, false if not.

Methods for Removing Elements:
6.	removeFirst() and removeLast():
	Retrieves and removes the first or last element of the deque.
	Throws an exception if the deque is empty.
	
8. pollFirst() and pollLast():
	Retrieves and removes the first or last element of the deque, or returns null if empty.
	
Methods for Examining Elements:
10. getFirst() and getLast():
	Retrieves, but does not remove, the first or last element of the deque.
	Throws an exception if the deque is empty.
	
12. peekFirst() and peekLast():
	Retrieves, but does not remove, the first or last element of the deque, or returns null if empty.
	
Methods for Iterating Over Elements:
14. iterator() and descendingIterator():
	Returns an iterator over the elements in normal or reverse order, respectively.

Methods for Stack Operations:
15. push(E e):
	Inserts the specified element at the front of the deque.
	Equivalent to addFirst(E e).
	
16. pop():
	Retrieves and removes the first element of the deque.
	Equivalent to removeFirst().
	
Other Methods:
18. removeFirstOccurrence(Object o) and removeLastOccurrence(Object o):
	Removes the first or last occurrence of the specified element from the deque, if present.
	Returns true if an element was removed.
	
19. offer(E e):
	Adds the specified element to the end of the deque.
	Equivalent to offerLast(E e).
	
19. poll():
	Retrieves and removes the first element of the deque, or returns null if empty.
	Equivalent to pollFirst().
	
20. element():
	Retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of the deque.
	Equivalent to getFirst().
	
21. peek():
	Retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of the deque, or returns null if empty.
	Equivalent to peekFirst().
