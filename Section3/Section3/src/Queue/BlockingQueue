BlockingQueue is an interface in   that extends the Queue interface and
adds support for operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when
retrieving an element and wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element.

Implementing classes of the BlockingDeque:
1. LinkedBlockingDeque:
	Description: Implements a linked (unbounded) blocking deque.
	BlockingDeque<String> deque = new LinkedBlockingDeque<>();
	
2. LinkedBlockingDeque with Capacity:
	Description: Similar to LinkedBlockingDeque but with a specified capacity.
	BlockingDeque<String> dequeWithCapacity = new LinkedBlockingDeque<>(10);
	
3. ArrayBlockingDeque:
	Description: Implements an array-backed blocking deque with a fixed capacity.
	BlockingDeque<String> arrayDeque = new ArrayBlockingDeque<>(10);

4. PriorityBlockingDeque:
	Description: Implements a blocking priority deque. 
	The elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or by a specified comparator.
	BlockingDeque<String> priorityDeque = new PriorityBlockingDeque<>()

Methods in BlockingQueue:
1. put(E e):
	Adds the specified element to the queue, waiting if necessary for space to become available.
	
2. take():
	Retrieves and removes an element from the front of the queue,
	waiting if necessary until an element becomes available.

3. offer(E e, long timeout, TimeUnit unit):
	Inserts the specified element into this queue, 
	waiting up to the specified timeout if necessary for space to become available.

4. poll(long timeout, TimeUnit unit):
	Retrieves and removes the head of this queue,
	waiting up to the specified timeout if necessary for an element to become available.

5. remainingCapacity():
	Returns the number of additional elements that this queue can ideally
	(in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without blocking.

6. drainTo(Collection<? super E> c):
	Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection.
	
7.drainTo(Collection<? super E> c, int maxElements):
	Removes at most the given number of available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection.
