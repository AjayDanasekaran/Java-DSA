Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map.

3. K firstKey(): 
Returns the first (lowest) key currently in this map.

4. SortedMap<K,V> headMap(K toKey): 
Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are strictly less than toKey.

5. Set<K> keySet(): 
Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map.

6. K lastKey(): 
Returns the last (highest) key currently in this map.

7. SortedMap<K,V> subMap(K fromKey, K toKey): 
Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys range from fromKey (inclusive) to toKey (exclusive).

8. SortedMap<K,V> tailMap(K fromKey): 
Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than or equal to fromKey.

9. Collection<V> values():
