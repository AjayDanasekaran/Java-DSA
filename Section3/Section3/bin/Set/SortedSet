SortedSet interface in Java extends the Set interface and introduces methods specifically
related to the sorted nature of the set. Here are some of the methods that are part of the
SortedSet interface and not present in the more general Set interface:

1. Comparator<? super E> comparator():
Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this sorted set, 
or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements.

2. E first():
Returns the first (lowest) element in this sorted set.

3. E last():
Returns the last (highest) element in this sorted set.

4. SortedSet<E> headSet(E toElement):
Returns a view of the portion of this sorted set whose elements are strictly less than toElement.

5. SortedSet<E> tailSet(E fromElement):
Returns a view of the portion of this sorted set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement.

6. SortedSet<E> subSet(E fromElement, E toElement):
Returns a view of the portion of this sorted set whose elements range from fromElement (inclusive) to toElement (exclusive).
