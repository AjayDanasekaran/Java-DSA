Thread Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------Start vs Run------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. start()										 |run()
2. Creates a new thread and the run() method is  |No new thread is created and the run() method is executed on the calling thread itself.
   executed on the newly created thread.		 |
3. Can’t be invoked more than one time otherwise |Multiple invocation is possible
   throws java.lang.IllegalStateException        |
4. Defined in java.lang.Thread class.            |Defined in java.lang.Runnable interface and must be overridden in the implementing class.

-----------------------------------------------------Yield vs Sleep----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Property       |Yield Method 										  |Sleep Method
1.Purpose      |If a thread wants to pause its execution to give      |If a thread doesn’t want to perform any operation for a particular
		       |chance for the remaining thread of the same priority  |amount of time then we should go for the sleep method.
		       |then we should go for the yield method.               |
2.Over-loading |This method is not overloaded 						  |The sleep method is overloaded.
3.Exception    |This method doesn’t throw an exception 				  |This method throws  Interrupted Exception,IllegalArgument Exception

Sleep(): This Method is used to pause the execution of current thread for a specified time in Milliseconds. 
		 Here, Thread does not lose its ownership of the monitor and resume’s it’s execution

Wait(): This method is defined in object class. 
        It tells the calling thread (a.k.a Current Thread) to wait until another thread invoke’s the notify() or notifyAll()
        method for this object, The thread waits until it reobtains the ownership of the monitor and Resume’s Execution.
        
-----------------------------------------------------Wait vs Sleep-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Wait()													|Sleep()
2. Wait() method belongs to Object class.					|Sleep() method belongs to Thread class.
3. Wait() should be called only from Synchronized context.  |There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context.
4. Wait() is not a static method. 							|Sleep() is a static method. 
5. Wait() Has Three Overloaded Methods:						|Sleep() Has Two Overloaded Methods:
wait()														|sleep(long millis)millis: milliseconds
wait(long timeout)											|sleep(long millis,int nanos) nanos: Nanoseconds
wait(long timeout, int nanos)								|

yield():
If a thread wants to pass its execution to give chance to remaining threads of the same priority then we should go for yield()

join():
If a thread wants to wait until completing of some other thread then we should go for join()

sleep():
If a thread does not want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time, then it goes for sleep()

5)wait() method causes the thread to sleep until 		   |It can be used to add sequence among more than one thread
