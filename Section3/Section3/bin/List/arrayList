ArrayList is a class in Java that belongs to the java.util package and provides dynamic array-like functionality.
While many of its methods are common with other collection classes,
there are some methods specific to ArrayList that are not available in other classes without code.
Here are a few of them:

1. trimToSize():
	This method trims the capacity of an ArrayList instance to be the list's current size.
	It reduces the internal array size to the size of the elements currently in the list.

2. ensureCapacity(int minCapacity):
	This method increases the capacity of an ArrayList instance,
	if necessary, to ensure that it can hold at least the specified number of elements.
	It is useful when you know in advance that you will be adding a large number of elements.

3. clone():
	The clone() method in ArrayList creates a shallow copy of the ArrayList.
	While the clone() method is available for other classes, the behavior of cloning may vary depending on the class,
	and it's not guaranteed to be a shallow copy.
	
4. indexOf(Object o) and lastIndexOf(Object o):
	These methods return the index of the first/last occurrence of the specified element in the list.
	While similar methods exist in other List implementations, the specific behavior might differ.
	
5. removeRange(int fromIndex, int toIndex):
	This method removes all elements from the ArrayList that fall within the specified range. 
	It's a more specific operation compared to subList() in other List implementations.
